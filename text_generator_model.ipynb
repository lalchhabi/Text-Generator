Daily Life Conversation: Coffee Shop Encounter Setting: A cozy coffee shop in the afternoon. The warm aroma of coffee beans fills the air as sunlight streams through the windows.  Characters:  Sarah: A young professional, dressed in business attire, working on her laptop. Mark: An elderly gentleman, reading a book and sipping coffee. [SCENE START]  Sarah: (Sighs deeply, rubbing her tired eyes) Ugh, this report is never going to finish itself.  Mark: (Looks up from his book with a smile) Rough day?  Sarah: (Startled, looks up) Oh, I didn\\'t see you there. Yeah, it\\'s been one of those days. Deadlines, meetings, the whole shebang.  Mark: I remember those days. The corporate grind can be a real beast.  Sarah: You seem to be enjoying yours. The book, the coffee, the calmnessâ€¦ it\\'s all very enviable.  Mark: (Chuckles) It has its perks. Retirement isn\\'t all it\\'s cracked up to be, but I do enjoy the simple things now.  Sarah: Simple things? Like reading a book in a coffee shop?  Mark: Exactly. It\\'s the little moments that we often miss amidst the rush of everyday life. The smell of freshly brewed coffee, the feel of turning a page, the chance encounter with a strangerâ€¦  Sarah: (Thinks for a moment) You know, you\\'re right. I\\'ve been so focused on getting ahead that I\\'ve forgotten to appreciate the little things.  Mark: We all get caught up in the rat race sometimes. But it\\'s important to take a step back and remind ourselves what truly matters.  Sarah: I think I needed to hear that. Thank you.  Mark: You\\'re welcome, young lady. Now, how about another cup of coffee? It\\'s on me.  Sarah: (Smiling) I\\'d love that. And maybe, just maybe, I can focus on the book instead of the report for a while.

The Last Coffee Shop: Chapter 1 - A Spark of Rebellion Setting: A hidden alleyway in a bustling cityscape. Sunlight filters through the grimy windows of a small, unassuming establishment called \"The Last Drip.\" Inside, the warm aroma of coffee mingles with hushed conversations and the rhythmic clinking of spoons against ceramic mugs.  Characters:  Eleanor (20s): Fiery and determined owner of The Last Drip, a skilled barista with a passion for freedom. David (30s): A weary journalist seeking solace and information in The Last Drip, haunted by his past. Agent Thorne (40s): A ruthless enforcer of the coffee ban, driven by a dark secret. [SCENE START]  Eleanor meticulously polishes the countertop, her movements fluid and practiced. The morning rush has subsided, leaving only a handful of patrons huddled over steaming mugs, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of hanging lamps. An air of secrecy and quiet defiance hangs heavy in the air.  David enters, his eyes scanning the dimly lit space. He\\'s drawn to the aroma of coffee, a forbidden scent in a city where the government has outlawed its consumption. His weathered face carries a worn expression, a testament to years spent chasing stories and facing danger.  \"Is this... The Last Drip?\" he asks in a hushed tone.  Eleanor raises an eyebrow, a hint of amusement playing on her lips. \"That\\'s right. Last stop on the caffeine train. What can I get you?\"  David hesitates, taking in the clandestine atmosphere. The other patrons, a diverse mix of artists, intellectuals, and everyday citizens seeking a taste of the past, cast him curious glances.  \"Black,\" he says finally, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Strong.\"  Eleanor nods, her movements a symphony of precision as she grinds the beans, measures the water, and extracts the perfect cup of coffee. The aroma alone is enough to awaken David\\'s senses, transporting him back to a time before the ban, a time when coffee wasn\\'t a rebellious act but a simple pleasure enjoyed by all.  As David savors the first sip, his eyes widen in surprise. The flavor is nothing like the synthetic substitutes he\\'s forced to endure. It\\'s bold, rich, and complex, a reminder of a forgotten world.  \"This is...\" he begins, his voice thick with emotion. \"This is incredible. I haven\\'t tasted anything like it.\"  \"It\\'s real coffee, friend,\" Eleanor replies, her voice low and conspiratorial. \"Not the synthetic trash they call coffee on the streets. We serve more than just a drink here. We serve a reminder of freedom, of what life used to be like.\"  David looks around the room, his gaze flickering over the faces of the patrons. He sees a shared yearning for something more, a spark of rebellion burning just beneath the surface. In this hidden sanctuary, amidst the fragrant steam and whispered conversations, he senses a movement growing, a resistance against the oppressive regime that controls their lives.  Suddenly, the door bursts open and a figure strides in, his face etched with grim determination. It\\'s Agent Thorne, a man feared and respected for his ruthless enforcement of the coffee ban. His presence instantly silences the room, replacing the murmur of conversation with a tense silence.  \"This establishment is in violation of the Coffee Prohibition Act,\" Thorne announces in a cold, authoritative voice. \"You are all under arrest.\"  [TO BE CONTINUED]  This is just the beginning of Chapter 1.

The world of The Last Coffee Shop is ripe with possibilities, so let your imagination run wild and bring this story to life!    In computing, plain text is a loose term for data (e.g. file contents) that represent only characters of readable material but not its graphical representation nor other objects (floating-point numbers, images, etc.). It may also include a limited number of \"whitespace\" characters that affect simple arrangement of text, such as spaces, line breaks, or tabulation characters. Plain text is different from formatted text, where style information is included; from structured text, where structural parts of the document such as paragraphs, sections, and the like are identified; and from binary files in which some portions must be interpreted as binary objects (encoded integers, real numbers, images, etc.).  The term is sometimes used quite loosely, to mean files that contain only \"readable\" content (or just files with nothing that the speaker does not prefer). For example, that could exclude any indication of fonts or layout (such as markup, markdown, or even tabs); characters such as curly quotes, non-breaking spaces, soft hyphens, em dashes, and/or ligatures; or other things.  In principle, plain text can be in any encoding, but occasionally the term is taken to imply ASCII. As Unicode-based encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16 become more common, that usage may be shrinking.  Plain text is also sometimes used only to exclude \"binary\" files: those in which at least some parts of the file cannot be correctly interpreted via the character encoding in effect. For example, a file or string consisting of \"hello\" (in any encoding), following by 4 bytes that express a binary integer that is not a character, is a binary file. Converting a plain text file to a different character encoding does not change the meaning of the text, as long as the correct character encoding is used. However, converting a binary file to a different format may alter the interpretation of the non-textual data.  Plain text and rich text According to The Unicode Standard:[1]  \"Plain text is a pure sequence of character codes; plain Un-encoded text is therefore a sequence of Unicode character codes. In contrast, styled text, also known as rich text, is any text representation containing plain text plus added information such as a language identifier, font size, color, hypertext links, and so on. SGML, RTF, HTML, XML, and TeX are examples of rich text fully represented as plain text streams, interspersing plain text data with sequences of characters that represent the additional data structures.\" According to other definitions, however, files that contain markup or other meta-data are generally considered plain text, so long as the markup is also in a directly human-readable form (as in HTML, XML, and so on). Thus, representations such as SGML, RTF, HTML, XML, wiki markup, and TeX, as well as nearly all programming language source code files, are considered plain text. The particular content is irrelevant to whether a file is plain text. For example, an SVG file can express drawings or even bitmapped graphics, but is still plain text.  The use of plain text rather than binary files enables files to survive much better \"in the wild\", in part by making them largely immune to computer architecture incompatibilities. For example, all the problems of Endianness can be avoided (with encodings such as UCS-2 rather than UTF-8, endianness matters, but uniformly for every character, rather than for potentially-unknown subsets of it).  Usage The purpose of using plain text today is primarily independence from programs that require their very own special encoding or formatting or file format. Plain text files can be opened, read, and edited with ubiquitous text editors and utilities.  A command-line interface allows people to give commands in plain text and get a response, also typically in plain text.  Many other computer programs are also capable of processing or creating plain text, such as countless programs in DOS, Windows, classic Mac OS, and Unix and its kin; as well as web browsers (a few browsers such as Lynx and the Line Mode Browser produce only plain text for display) and other e-text readers.  Plain text files are almost universal in programming; a source code file containing instructions in a programming language is almost always a plain text file. Plain text is also commonly used for configuration files, which are read for saved settings at the startup of a program.  Plain text is used for much e-mail.  A comment, a \".txt\" file, or a TXT Record generally contains only plain text (without formatting) intended for humans to read.  The best format for storing knowledge persistently is plain text, rather than some binary format.[2]  Encoding Character encodings Main article: Character encoding Before the early 1960s, computers were mainly used for number-crunching rather than for text, and memory was extremely expensive. Computers often allocated only 6 bits for each character, permitting only 64 charactersâ€”assigning codes for A-Z, a-z, and 0-9 would leave only 2 codes: nowhere near enough. Most computers opted not to support lower-case letters. Thus, early text projects such as Roberto Busa\\'s Index Thomisticus, the Brown Corpus, and others had to resort to conventions such as keying an asterisk preceding letters actually intended to be upper-case.  Fred Brooks of IBM argued strongly for going to 8-bit bytes, because someday people might want to process text and won. Although IBM used EBCDIC, most text from then on came to be encoded in ASCII, using values from 0 to 31 for (non-printing) control characters, and values from 32 to 127 for graphic characters such as letters, digits, and punctuation. Most machines stored characters in 8 bits rather than 7, ignoring the remaining bit or using it as a checksum.  The near-ubiquity of ASCII was a great help, but failed to address international and linguistic concerns. The dollar-sign (\"$\") was not as useful in England, and the accented characters used in Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and many other languages were entirely unavailable in ASCII (not to mention characters used in Greek, Russian, and most Eastern languages). Many individuals, companies, and countries defined extra characters as neededâ€”often reassigning control characters, or using values in the range from 128 to 255. Using values above 128 conflicts with using the 8th bit as a checksum, but the checksum usage gradually died out.  These additional characters were encoded differently in different countries, making texts impossible to decode without figuring out the originator\\'s rules. For instance, a browser might display Â¬A rather than ` if it tried to interpret one character set as another. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) eventually developed several code pages under ISO 8859, to accommodate various languages. The first of these (ISO 8859-1) is also known as \"Latin-1\", and covers the needs of most (not all) European languages that use Latin-based characters (there was not quite enough room to cover them all). ISO 2022 then provided conventions for \"switching\" between different character sets in mid-file. Many other organisations developed variations on these, and for many years Windows and Macintosh computers used incompatible variations.  The text-encoding situation became more and more complex, leading to efforts by ISO and by the Unicode Consortium to develop a single, unified character encoding that could cover all known (or at least all currently known) languages. After some conflict,[citation needed] these efforts were unified. Unicode currently allows for 1,114,112 code values, and assigns codes covering nearly all modern text writing systems, as well as many historical ones, and for many non-linguistic characters such as printer\\'s dingbats, mathematical symbols, etc.  Text is considered plain text regardless of its encoding. To properly understand or process it the recipient must know (or be able to figure out) what encoding was used; however, they need not know anything about the computer architecture that was used, or about the binary structures defined by whatever program (if any) created the data.  Perhaps the most common way of explicitly stating the specific encoding of plain text is with a MIME type. For email and HTTP, the default MIME type is \"text/plain\" -- plain text without markup. Another MIME type often used in both email and HTTP is \"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" -- plain text represented using the UTF-8 character encoding with HTML markup. Another common MIME type is \"application/json\" -- plain text represented using the UTF-8 character encoding with JSON markup.  When a document is received without any explicit indication of the character encoding, some applications use charset detection to attempt to guess what encoding was used.  Control codes Main article: C0 and C1 control codes ASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0â€“31 decimal) for control characters known as the \"C0 set\": codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as printers) that make use of ASCII, or to provide meta-information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape. They include common characters like the newline and the tab character.  In 8-bit character sets such as Latin-1 and the other ISO 8859 sets, the first 32 characters of the \"upper half\" (128 to 159) are also control codes, known as the \"C1 set\". They are rarely used directly; when they turn up in documents which are ostensibly in an ISO 8859 encoding, their code positions generally refer instead to the characters at that position in a proprietary, system-specific encoding, such as Windows-1252 or Mac OS Roman, that use the codes to instead provide additional graphic characters.  Main article: Unicode control characters Unicode defines additional control characters, including bi-directional text direction override characters (used to explicitly mark right-to-left writing inside left-to-right writing and the other way around) and variation selectors to select alternate forms of CJK ideographs, emoji and  The One Where Monica Gets a New Roommate (The Pilot-The Uncut Version) Written by: Marta Kauffman & David Crane   [Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are there.]  Monica: There\\'s nothing to tell!

Monica: (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?  Rachel: Hi, sure!  Ross: Hi.  (They go to hug but Ross\\'s umbrella opens.  He sits back down defeated again.  A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others expect her to explain.)  Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?  Rachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet \\'n\\' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that\\'s when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y\\'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering \\'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?\\'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn\\'t know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you\\'re the only person I knew who lived here in the city.  Monica: Who wasn\\'t invited to the wedding.  Rachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn\\'t be an issue... [Scene: Monica\\'s Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on.]  Monica: Now I\\'m guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she\\'s really not happy about it.  Chandler: (imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!  Ross: (in a deep voice) I\\'ll have whatever Christine is having.  Rachel: (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can\\'t marry him! I\\'m sorry. I just don\\'t love him. Well, it matters to me!  (The scene on TV has changed to show two women, one is holding her hair.)  Phoebe:  If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.  Chandler: (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.  Joey: I say push her down the stairs.  Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:  Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!  (She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)  Rachel: C\\'mon Daddy, listen to me! It\\'s like, it\\'s like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, \\'You\\'re a shoe! You\\'re a shoe, you\\'re a shoe, you\\'re a shoe!\\'. And today I just stopped and I said, \\'What if I don\\'t wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y\\'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I\\'m not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I\\'m saying I am a ha- It\\'s a metaphor, Daddy!  Ross: You can see where he\\'d have trouble.  Rachel: Look Daddy, it\\'s my life. Well maybe I\\'ll just stay here with Monica.  Monica: Well, I guess we\\'ve established who\\'s staying here with Monica...  Rachel: Well, maybe that\\'s my decision. Well, maybe I don\\'t need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!  [Time Lapse, Rachel is breating into a paper bag.]  Monica: Just breathe, breathe.. that\\'s it. Just try to think of nice calm things...  Phoebe: (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...  Rachel: I\\'m all better now.  Phoebe: (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!  Monica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y\\'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, \\'hat\\' thing.  Joey: (comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he\\'s away a lot.  Monica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It\\'s her wedding day!  Joey: What, like there\\'s a rule or something?  (The door buzzer sounds and Chandler gets it.)  Chandler: Please don\\'t do that again, it\\'s a horrible sound.  Paul: (over the intercom) It\\'s, uh, it\\'s Paul.  Monica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!  Joey: Who\\'s Paul?  Ross: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?  Monica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your \\'not a real date\\' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?  Ross: He finally asked you out?  Monica: Yes!  Chandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.  Monica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...  Rachel: Please, no, go, that\\'d be fine!  Monica: (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?  Ross: (choked voice) That\\'d be good...  Monica: (horrified) Really?  Ross: (normal voice) No, go on! It\\'s Paul the Wine Guy!  Phoebe: What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn\\'t know.)  (There\\'s a knock on the door and it\\'s Paul.)  Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.  All: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!  Chandler: I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t catch your name. Paul, was it?  Monica: Okay, umm-umm, I\\'ll just--I\\'ll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...  Ross: A wandering?  Monica: Change!  Okay, sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds.  Phoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can\\'t be good.  (Monica goes to change.)  Joey:  Hey, Paul!  Paul: Yeah?  Joey: Here\\'s a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.  Monica: (yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey!  Ross: So Rachel, what\\'re you, uh... what\\'re you up to tonight?  Rachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!  Ross: Right, you\\'re not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don\\'t feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.  Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, and we\\'re very excited about it.  Rachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I\\'m just gonna hang out here tonight.  It\\'s been kinda a long day.  Ross: Okay, sure.  Joey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?  Phoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don\\'t want to.  Commercial Break  [Scene: The Subway, Phoebe is singing for change.]  Phoebe: (singing) Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!  [Scene: Ross\\'s Apartment, the guys are there assembling furniture.]  Ross: (squatting and reading the instructions) I\\'m supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.  (Joey and Chandler are finishing assembling the bookcase.)  Joey: I\\'m thinking we\\'ve got a bookcase here.  Chandler: It\\'s a beautiful thing.  Joey: (picking up a leftover part) What\\'s this?  Chandler: I would have to say that is an \\'L\\'-shaped bracket.  Joey: Which goes where?  Chandler: I have no idea.  (Joey checks that Ross is not looking and dumps it in a plant.)  Joey: Done with the bookcase!  Chandler: All finished!  Ross: (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carol\\'s favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.  Joey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you\\'re gonna start with that stuff we\\'re outta here.  Chandler: Yes, please don\\'t spoil all this fun.  Joey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?  Ross: You guys.  Chandler: Oh, God.  Joey: You got screwed.  Chandler: Oh my God!  [Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are eating.]  Monica: Oh my God!  Paul: I know, I know, I\\'m such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?  Monica: My brother\\'s going through that right now, he\\'s such a mess. How did you get through it?  Paul: Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-  Monica: -leg?  Paul: (laughing) That\\'s one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.  Monica: You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend\\'s favorite bath towel.  Paul: Ooh, steer clear of you.  Monica: That\\'s right. [Scene: Monica\\'s Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]  Rachel: Barry, I\\'m sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn\\'t... it isn\\'t, it\\'s about me, and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn\\'t me, it\\'s not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)  [Scene: Ross\\'s Apartment; Ross is pacing while Joey and Chandler are working on some more furniture.]  Ross: I\\'m divorced!  I\\'m only 26 and I\\'m divorced!  Joey: Shut up!  Chandler: You must stop! (Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)  Ross: That only took me an hour.  Chandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven\\'t had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don\\'t do it!  I don\\'t think that was my point!  Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if there\\'s only one woman for everybody, y\\'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that\\'s it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...  Joey: What are you talking about? \\'One woman\\'? That\\'s like saying there\\'s only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There\\'s lots of flavors out there. There\\'s Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get \\'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!  Ross: I honestly don\\'t know if I\\'m hungry or horny.  Chandler: Stay out of my freezer! [Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]  Paul: Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...  Monica: What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?  Paul: No, it\\'s, it\\'s more of a fifth date kinda revelation.  Monica: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?  Paul: Isn\\'t there?  Monica: Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?  Paul: Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven\\'t been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually.  Monica: (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...  Paul: It\\'s okay...  Monica: I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?  Paul: Two years.  Monica: Wow! I\\'m-I\\'m-I\\'m glad you smashed her watch!  Paul: So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?  Monica: (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do.  [Scene: Monica\\'s Apartment, Rachel is watching Joanne Loves Chaci.]  Priest on TV: We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.  Rachel: Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That\\'s the difference!  [Scene: Ross\\'s Apartment, they\\'re all sitting around and talking.]  Ross: (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it\\'s been since I\\'ve grabbed a spoon? Do the words \\'Billy, don\\'t be a hero\\' mean anything to you?  Joey: Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)  Chandler: Angela\\'s the screamer, Andrea has cats.  Joey: Right.  Thanks.  It\\'s June.  I\\'m outta here. (Exits.)  Ross: Y\\'know, here\\'s the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the window.)  [Cut to Rachel staring out of her window.]  Commercial Break  [Scene: Monica\\'s Apartment, Rachel is making coffee for Joey and Chandler.]  Rachel: Isn\\'t this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.  Chandler: That is amazing.  Joey: Congratulations.  Rachel: Y\\'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do.  Chandler: If can invade Poland, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do.  Joey: Listen, while you\\'re on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I\\'m really not that hungry...  Monica: (entering, to herself) Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.  All: Morning. Good morning.  Paul: (entering from Monica\\'s room) Morning.  Joey: Morning, Paul.  Rachel: Hello, Paul.  Chandler: Hi, Paul, is it?  (Monica and Paul walk to the door and talk in a low voice so the others can\\'t hear.  The others move Monica\\'s table closer to the door so that they can.)  Paul: Thank you!  Thank you so much!  Monica: Stop!  Paul: No, I\\'m telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.  Monica: We\\'ll talk later.  Paul: Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)  Joey: That wasn\\'t a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?  Monica: Shut up, and put my table back.  All: Okayyy! (They do so.)  Chandler: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don\\'t input those numbers,... it doesn\\'t make much of a difference...  Rachel: So, like, you guys all have jobs?  Monica: Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that\\'s how we buy stuff.  Joey: Yeah, I\\'m an actor.  Rachel: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?  Joey: I doubt it. Mostly regional work.  Monica: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns\\' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.  Joey: Look, it was a job all right?  Chandler: \\'Look, Gippetto, I\\'m a real live boy.\\'  Joey: I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door and opens it to leave.)  Chandler: You\\'re right, I\\'m sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) \"Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...\"  Joey: You should both know, that he\\'s a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.)  Monica: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can\\'t stop smiling.  Rachel: I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.  Monica: I know, he\\'s just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?  Rachel: Oh, yeah.  Monica: Well, it\\'s like that. With feelings.  Rachel: Oh wow. Are you in trouble.  Monica: Big time!  Rachel: Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.  Monica: I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I\\'m just gonna get up and go to work.  Rachel: Oh, look, wish me luck!  Monica: What for?  Rachel: I\\'m gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job things.  (Monica exits.)  [Scene: Iridium, Monica is working as Frannie enters.]  Frannie: Hey, Monica!  Monica: Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?  Frannie: You had sex, didn\\'t you?  Monica: How do you do that?  Frannie: Oh, I hate you, I\\'m pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you\\'re having sex!  So? Who?  Monica: You know Paul?  Frannie: Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.  Monica: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?  Frannie: Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y\\'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.  [Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.]  Joey: (sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line!  Monica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?  Ross: I assume we\\'re looking for an answer more sophisticated than \\'to get you into bed\\'.  Monica: I hate men!  I hate men!  Phoebe: Oh no, don\\'t hate, you don\\'t want to put that out into the universe.  Monica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?  Phoebe: All right, c\\'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)  Monica: I just thought he was nice, y\\'know?  Joey: (bursts out laughing again) I can\\'t believe you didn\\'t know it was a line!  (Monica pushes him off of the sofa as Rachel enters with a shopping bag.)  Rachel: Guess what?  Ross: You got a job?  Rachel: Are you kidding? I\\'m trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.  Chandler: And yet you\\'re surprisingly upbeat.  Rachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!  Chandler: Oh, how well you know me...  Rachel: They\\'re my new \\'I don\\'t need a job, I don\\'t need my parents, I\\'ve got great boots\\' boots!  Monica: How\\'d you pay for them?  Rachel: Uh, credit card.  Monica: And who pays for that?  Rachel: Um... my... father.  [Scene: Monica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is sitting around the kitchen table.   Rachel\\'s credit cards are spread out on the table along with a pair of scissors.]  Rachel: Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.  Monica: C\\'mon, you can\\'t live off your parents your whole life.  Rachel: I know that. That\\'s why I was getting married.  Phoebe: Give her a break, it\\'s hard being on your own for the first time.  Rachel: Thank you.  Phoebe: You\\'re welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn\\'t know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.  (Pause)  Ross: The word you\\'re looking for is \\'Anyway\\'...  Monica: All right, you ready?  Rachel: No.  No, no, I\\'m not ready!  How can I be ready?  \"Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\"  Come on, I can\\'t do this!  Monica: You can, I know you can!  Rachel: I don\\'t think so.  Ross: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)  Ross: C\\'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...  All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)  Rachel: Y\\'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It\\'s kinda like a symbolic gesture...  Monica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!  All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..  Chandler: (as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y\\'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.  (She finishes cutting them up and they all cheer.)  Monica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You\\'re gonna love it!  [Time Lapse, Rachel and Ross are watching a TV channel finishes it\\'s broadcast day by playing the national anthem.]  Monica: Well, that\\'s it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch?  Ross: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.  Monica: You be okay?  Ross: Yeah.  Rachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?  Monica: That\\'s Paul\\'s watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.  Ross and Rachel: Goodnight.  (Monica stomps on Paul\\'s watch and goes into her room.)  Ross: Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no-  Rachel: Sorry-  Ross: No no no, go-  Rachel: No, you have it, really, I don\\'t want it-  Ross: Split it?  Rachel: Okay.  Ross: Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn\\'t know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.  Rachel: I knew.  Ross: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica\\'s geeky older brother.  Rachel: I did.  Ross: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?  Rachel: Yeah, maybe...  Ross: Okay... okay, maybe I will...  Rachel: Goodnight.  Ross: Goodnight.  (Rachel goes into her room and Monica enters the living room as Ross is leaving.)  Monica: See ya.... Waitwait, what\\'s with you?  Ross: I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means.)  Closing Credits  [Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]  Joey: I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing here.  Phoebe: (sings) I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing here...  Monica: What? I-I said you had a-  Phoebe: (sings) What I said you had...  Monica: (to Phoebe) Would you stop?  Phoebe: Oh, was I doing it again?  All: Yes!  Monica: I said that you had a nice butt, it\\'s just not a great butt.  Joey: Oh, you wouldn\\'t know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.  Ross: There\\'s an image.  Rachel: (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee?  Chandler: Did you make it, or are you just serving it?  Rachel: I\\'m just serving it.  All: Yeah. Yeah, I\\'ll have a cup of coffee.  Chandler: Kids, new dream... I\\'m in Las Vegas. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler\\'s dream.)  Customer: (To Rachel) Ahh, miss?   More coffee?  Rachel: Ugh. (To another customer that\\'s leaving.) Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank you. (To the gang.) Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas.  Chandler: Okay, so, I\\'m in Las Vegas... I\\'m Liza Minelli-  End  The One With the Sonogram at the End Written by: Marta Kauffman & David Crane   [Scene Central Perk, everyone\\'s there.]  Monica: What you guys don\\'t understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.  Joey: Yeah, right!.......Y\\'serious?  Phoebe: Oh, yeah!  Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.  Monica: Absolutely.  Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y\\'know? I mean it\\'s like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.  Ross: Yeah, and-and it\\'s not that we don\\'t like the comedian, it\\'s that-that... that\\'s not why we bought the ticket.  Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert\\'s over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y\\'know? I mean, we\\'re in the car, we\\'re fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.  Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you\\'re gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.  Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?  Opening Credits  [Scene: Museum of Prehistoric History, Ross and a co-worker (Marsha) are setting up an exhibit which includes some mannequins of cave people.]  Ross: No, it\\'s good, it is good, it\\'s just that- mm- doesn\\'t she seem a little angry?  Marsha: Well, she has issues.  Ross: Does she.  Marsha: He\\'s out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!  Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like \\'Gee, that glacier\\'s getting kinda close.\\' See?  Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn\\'t that your ex-wife?  (Carol, Ross\\'s ex-wife, has entered behind them and is standing outstide the exhibit.)  Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No.  Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!  Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I\\'ll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.  (Marsha extis and Ross waves Carol into the exhibit.)  Ross:Hi.  Carol: So.  Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that.  Carol: Sorry. You look good too.  Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what\\'s new? Still, uh...  Carol: A lesbian?  Ross: Well... you never know. How\\'s, um.. how\\'s the family?  Carol: Marty\\'s still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-  Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol?  Carol: I\\'m pregnant.  Ross: Pregnant?!  [Scene: Monica and Rachel\\'s, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are watching Three\\'s Company.]  Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three\\'s Company where there\\'s some kind of misunderstanding.  Phoebe:...Then I\\'ve already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)  Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?  Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.  Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!  Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn\\'t need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.  (Monica starts to fluff a pillow.)  Phoebe: She\\'s already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you\\'ve already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it\\'s fine!  Monica: Look , I\\'m sorry, guys, I just don\\'t wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.  Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child\\'s pillow.  Phoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you\\'re scaring me. I mean, you\\'re like, you\\'re like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.  Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don\\'t see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.  Monica: That\\'s because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y\\'see, he\\'s the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.  Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!  Monica: What?  Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!  All: Eeaagh!  (Rachel enters from her room.)  Rachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?  Phoebe: Yeah, it\\'s beautiful.  Rachel: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under the couch cushions.)  Phoebe: No, look, don\\'t touch that!  Rachel: Oh, like I wasn\\'t dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... \\'Hi Barry! Remember me? I\\'m the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!\\' Oh God and now I\\'m gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...  Monica: Easy Rach, we\\'ll find it. (To all) Won\\'t we!  Chandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!  Joey: Alright, when\\'d\\'ya have it on last?  Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!  Chandler: You don\\'t get a lot of \\'doy\\' these days...  Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...  Chandler: ...Dinah?  Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don\\'t be mad...  Monica: You didn\\'t.  Rachel: Oh, I am sorry...  Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)  Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!  Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that\\'s not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...  Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can\\'t do it.  Chandler: Boys? We\\'re going in.  (Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe start to pick through the lasagne as there\\'s a knock on the door which Monica answers.)  Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi.  Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.  Ross: Carol\\'s pregnant.  Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it!  Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...  Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.)  Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?  Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?  Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I\\'m not comfortable with it, I don\\'t have to be involved.. basically it\\'s entirely up to me.  Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her.  Monica: What does she mean by \\'involved\\'?  Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.  Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.  Rachel: So what are you gonna do?  Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I\\'m still gonna be a father.  (Joey starts to eat the rest of the lasagne and everyone turns and stares at him.)  Joey: .....Well, this is still ruined, right?  [Scene, Monica and Rachel\\'s, Monica and Ross are pouring wine for their parents.]  Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin\\'s daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What\\'s that curry taste?  Monica: Curry.  Mrs. Geller: Mmmm!  Ross: I- I think they\\'re great! I, I really do.  Mr. Geller: (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn\\'t she?  Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him.  Ross: Aw, Mom...  Monica: I\\'m sorry, why is this girl going to call me?  Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don\\'t know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-  Monica: No Mom, I don\\'t have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.  Mrs. Geller: Well, they don\\'t have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)  Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?  Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)  Mrs. Geller: Oh, we\\'re having spaghetti! That\\'s.... easy.  Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.  [Time Lapse, everyone is now eating.]  Mrs. Geller: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.  Mr. Geller: I\\'m not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!  Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...  Monica: What\\'s that supposed to mean?  Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It\\'s an expression.  Monica: No it\\'s not.  Mr. Geller: Don\\'t listen to your mother. You\\'re independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...  [Time Lapse.]  Mr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I\\'m telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.  [Time Lapse.]  Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God \\'Our Little Harmonica\\' doesn\\'t seem to have that problem.  Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what\\'s going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?  Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here\\'s the deal. Carol\\'s a lesbian. She\\'s living with a woman named Susan. She\\'s pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.  (Stunned silence ensues.)  Mrs. Geller: (To Monica) And you knew about this?!  Commercial Break  [Scene: Central Park, everyone\\'s there.]  Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh?  Ross: Well, y\\'know, these people are pros. They know what they\\'re doing, they take their time, they get the job done.  Monica: Boy, I know they say you can\\'t change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I\\'d want yours.  Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.)  Phoebe: Y\\'know, it\\'s even worse when you\\'re twins.  Rachel: You\\'re twins?  Phoebe: Yeah. We don\\'t speak. She\\'s like this high-powered, driven career type.  Chandler: What does she do?  Phoebe: She\\'s a waitress.  Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.)  Monica: Chandler, you\\'re an only child, right? You don\\'t have any of this.  Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.  Rachel: The lights, please..  (Joey turns off the lights, and they all leave as Rachel starts to clean up.  Ross enters from the bathroom.)  Ross: ...How long was I in there?  Rachel: I\\'m just cleaning up.  Ross: D\\'ya.. uh.. d\\'ya need any help?  Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)  Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?  Rachel: Oh.. a little..  Ross: Mm-hmm..  Rachel: A lot.  Ross: Mm.  Rachel: So, got any advice? Y\\'know, as someone who\\'s recently been- dumped?  Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word \\'dumped\\'. Chances are he\\'s gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y\\'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it\\'ll be hard. Or, y\\'know, uh, hey!, I\\'ll go down there, and I\\'ll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...  Rachel: Oh, you\\'ve got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?  Ross: Got me.  Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together?  Ross: Yeah.  Rachel: I mean, didn\\'t you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that\\'d be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross?  Ross: Yes, yes!  Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I\\'d be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)  Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn\\'t have to move his hand.)  [Scene: Carol\\'s OB/GYN, Carol is waiting.]  Ross: (entering) Sorry I\\'m late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.  (Susan enters holding a drink.)  Susan: Hi.  Carol: Ross, you remember Susan.  Ross: How could I forget?  Susan: Ross.  Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we\\'re just waiting for...?  Carol: Dr. Oberman.  Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-  Susan: She.  Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?  Carol: Yes, and she\\'s very supportive.  Ross: Okay, that\\'s great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I\\'m- Oh.  Carol: Thanks.  Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..  Carol: Ross? That opens my cervix. (He drops it in horror.)  [Scene Barry\\'s office, Barry is working on patient, Robbie, as Rachel enters.]  Rachel: Barry?  Barry: C\\'mon in.  Rachel: (hesitates) Are you sure?  Barry: Yeah! It\\'s fine, it\\'s fine. Robbie\\'s gonna be here for hours.  Robbie: Huh?!  Barry: So, how ya doin?  Rachel: I\\'m- uh- I\\'m okay... You look great!  Barry: Yeah, well..  Bernice: (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein\\'s gagging.  Barry: (answering the intercom) Be right there. (To Robbie and Rachel) Be back in a sec.  (As Barry exits Robbie stares at Rachel.)  Rachel: I dumped him.  Robbie: Okay.  [Scene: Carol\\'s OB/GYN, they\\'re talking about how this is going to work.]  Ross: So, um- so how\\'s this, uh, how\\'s this gonna work? Y\\'know, with us? Y\\'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?  Carol: Give me a \\'for instance\\'.  Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don\\'t know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby\\'s name?  Carol: Marlon-  Ross: Marlon?!  Carol: -if it\\'s a boy, Minnie if it\\'s a girl.  Ross: ...As in Mouse?  Carol: As in my grandmother.  Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?  Carol: Julia..  Susan: We agreed on Minnie.  Ross: \\'S\\'funny, um, uh, we agreed we\\'d spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia\\'s on the table..?  [Scene: Barry\\'s office, Rachel is doing her makeup in the mirror on Barry\\'s lamp as Barry enters.]  Barry: Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?  Rachel: Oh, not much. I-I got a job.  Barry: Oh, that\\'s great.  Rachel: Why are- why are you so tanned?  Barry: Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.  Rachel: Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?  Barry: No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.  Robbie: Me?!  Barry: No! (To Rachel) I went with Mindy.  Rachel: Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!  Barry: Yeah, well, uh, we\\'re kind of a thing now.  Rachel: Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You\\'ve got plugs!  Barry: Careful! They haven\\'t quite taken yet.  Rachel: And you\\'ve got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!  Barry: Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.  Rachel: Okay..  Barry: See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I\\'ve ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I\\'m an orthodontist.  Rachel: Wow.  Barry: You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren\\'t happy. But with Mindy, now I\\'m happy. Spit.  Rachel: What?  Robbie: Me. (Spits.)  Rachel: Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.  Barry: Well, thank you for giving it back.  (Barry and Rachel look at each other.)  Robbie: Hello?!  [Scene: Carol\\'s OB/GYN, they\\'re still arguing about what to name the baby.]  Susan: Oh, please! What\\'s wrong with Helen?  Ross: Helen Geller? I don\\'t think so.  Carol: Hello? It\\'s not gonna be Helen Geller.  Ross: Thank you!  Carol: No, I mean it\\'s not Geller.  Ross: What, it\\'s gonna be Helen Willick?  Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.  Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?  Susan: It\\'s my baby too.  Ross: Oh, \\'s\\'funny, really? Um, I don\\'t remember you making any sperm.  Susan: Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!  Carol: All right, you two, stop it!  Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I\\'m in there too.  Carol: Ross. You\\'re not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? \\'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.  Ross: Of course not, I\\'m... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.  Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he\\'s doing? He knows no-one\\'s gonna say all those names, so they\\'ll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!  Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y\\'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I\\'m not, I can\\'t do-  Dr. Oberman: (entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?  All: Yeah. Yeah. A little.  Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back..  Ross: You- uh- y\\'know what, I\\'m gonna go. I don\\'t- I don\\'t think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.  (He turns to go, but the sound of the sonogram catches hes ear.  He returns and stares at it.)  Ross: Oh my God.  Susan: Look at that.  Carol: I know.  Closing Credits  [Scene: Monica and Rachel\\'s apartment, everyone is watching the tape of the sonogram.   Rachel is on the phone.]  Ross: Well? Isn\\'t that amazing?  Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here?  Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it\\'s about to attack the Enterprise.  Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.  Ross: Then don\\'t do that, alright?  Phoebe: Okay!  Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think?  Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm.  Ross: Wh- are you welling up?  Monica: No.  Ross: You are, you\\'re welling up.  Monica: Am not!  Ross: You\\'re gonna be an aunt.  Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!  Rachel: (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it\\'s Rachel. Yeah, I\\'m fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it\\'s okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y\\'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.  End  The One With the Thumb Written by: Jeffrey Astrof & Mike Sikowitz.   [Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Phoebe is there.]  Phoebe: (entering) Hi guys!  All: Hey, Pheebs! Hi!  Ross: Hey. Oh, oh, how\\'d it go?  Phoebe: Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said \\'We should do this again!\\'  All: Ohh. Ouch.  Rachel: What? He said \\'we should do it again\\', that\\'s good, right?  Monica: Uh, no. Loosely translated \\'We should do this again\\' means \\'You will never see me naked\\'.  Rachel: Since when?  Joey: Since always. It\\'s like dating language. Y\\'know, like \\'It\\'s not you\\' means \\'It is you\\'.  Chandler: Or \\'You\\'re such a nice guy\\' means \\'I\\'m gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you\\'.  Phoebe: Or, or, y\\'know, um, \\'I think we should see other people\\' means \\'Ha, ha, I already am\\'.  Rachel: And everybody knows this?  Joey: Yeah. Cushions the blow.  Chandler: Yeah, it\\'s like when you\\'re a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.  Ross: That\\'s funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.  Monica: Uh, Ross.  Ross: What? Wh- hello? The Millners\\' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!  Opening Credits  [Scene: Chandler and Joey\\'s, Chandler is helping Joey rehearse for a part.]  Chandler: \"So how does it feel knowing you\\'re about to die?\"  Joey: \"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you\\'ll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.\"  Chandler: Hey, that was really good!  Joey: Thanks! Let\\'s keep going.  Chandler: Okay. \"So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?\"  Joey: \"I just wanna go back to my cell. \\'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.\"  Chandler: \"Smoke away.\"  (Joey takes out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter.  He fumbles and drops the lighter.  Then he lights a cigarett, takes a drag, and coughs.)  Chandler: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.  Joey: What?  Chandler: Relax your hand!  (Joey lets his wrist go limp.)  Chandler: Not so much!  Joey: Whoah!  Chandler: Hey!  Joey: Hey!  Chandler: Alright, now try taking a puff.  (Joey tries and visibly winces.)  Chandler: Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.  Joey: No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.  Chandler: It\\'s fine, it\\'s fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.  (Joey reluctantly gives him the cigarette.)  Chandler: Don\\'t think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that\\'s been missing from your hand. When you\\'re holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.  Joey: Y\\'miss it?  Chandler: Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)  [Scene, Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe and Rachel is there.]  Monica: No, no, no. They say it\\'s the same as the distance from the tip of a guy\\'s thumb to the tip of his index finger.  (The guys stretch out their fingers.)  Joey: That\\'s ridiculous!  Ross: Can I use.. either thumb?  Rachel: (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don\\'t tell me, don\\'t tell me! (Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I\\'m getting pretty good at this!  All: Yeah. Yeah, excellent.  Rachel: (leaving to serve others) Good for me!  (The gang swaps all the drinks for what they ordered as Phoebe enters.  She sits down without saying hi.)  Joey: Y\\'okay, Phoebe?  Phoebe: Yeah- no- I\\'m just- it\\'s, I haven\\'t worked- It\\'s my bank.  Monica: What did they do to you?  Phoebe: It\\'s nothing, it\\'s just- Okay. I\\'m going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-  Ross: Easy.  Phoebe: - and there\\'s five hundred extra dollars in my account.  Chandler: Oh, Satan\\'s minions at work again...  Phoebe: Yes, \\'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.  Joey: What are you talking about? Keep it!  Phoebe: It\\'s not mine, I didn\\'t earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.  Rachel: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!  Phoebe: Okay. Okay, let\\'s say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I\\'d hear, with every step I took? \\'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.\\' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- \\'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine\\'...  Monica: We\\'re with you. We got it.  (Chandler leans over the back of the couch out of sight.)  Phoebe: Okay. I\\'d- just- I\\'d never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.  Rachel: Chandler, what are you doing?  Monica: (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?  (Chandler tries to shrug nonchalantly but eventually he has to exhale a mouthful of smoke.)  All: Oh! Oh, God!  Ross: What is this?!  Chandler: I\\'m smoking. I\\'m smoking, I\\'m smoking.  Phoebe: Oh, I can\\'t believe you! You\\'ve been so good, for three years!  Chandler: And this- is my reward!  Ross: Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.  Chandler: Okay, so this time I won\\'t quit!  All: Ohhh! Put it out!  Chandler: All right! I\\'m putting it out, I\\'m putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe\\'s coffee.)  Phoebe: Oh, no! I- I can\\'t drink this now!  Monica: Alright. I\\'m gonna go change, I\\'ve got a date.  Rachel: This Alan again? How\\'s it goin\\'?  Monica: \\'S\\'going pretty good, y\\'know? It\\'s nice, and, we\\'re having fun.  Joey: So when do we get to meet the guy?  Monica: Let\\'s see, today\\'s Monday... Never.  All: Oh, come on! Come on!  Monica: No. Not after what happened with Steve.  Chandler: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.  Monica: Look, I don\\'t even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.  Rachel: Well, then can we meet him?  Monica: Nope. Schhorry.  [Scene: Iridium, Monica and Paula are at work.]  Monica: I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they\\'re all over him. I mean, they\\'re like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.  Paula: Listen. As someone who\\'s seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I\\'ll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they\\'re your friends, they\\'re just looking out after you.  Monica: I know. I just wish that once, I\\'d bring a guy home that they actually liked.  Paula: Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..  [Scene: Monica and Rachel\\'s, Chandler is smoking out on the balcony, Phoebe is absent.]  Joey: Let it go, Ross.  Ross: Yeah, well, you didn\\'t know Chi Chi.  Monica: Do you all promise?  All: Yeah! We promise! We\\'ll be good!  Monica: (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?  (Chandler makes a \\'Cross my heart\\' sign.  It starts to rain and he taps on the window.)  Joey: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!  (Chandler sulkilty picks up a garbage can lid and uses it as an umbrella.)  (Phoebe enters, walks to the couch, sits down, and begins to read a letter without saying hi.)  Ross: Hey, Pheebs.  Phoebe: \\'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We\\'re sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you\\'ll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -football phone as our free gift.\\' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!  Rachel: What bank is this?  (The intercom buzzes.)  Monica: Hey. It\\'s him. (On the intercom) Who is it?  Alan: (on the intercom) It\\'s Alan.  Joey: (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He\\'s here!  (Chandler comes in, dripping wet.)  Monica: (to all) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.  (She opens the door and Alan enters.)  Monica: Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.  Alan: Hi.  All: Hi, Alan.  Alan: I\\'ve heard schho much about all you guyschh!  (Everyone laughs.)  [Time lapse, Alan is leaving.]  Monica: (to Alan) Thanks. I\\'ll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay. Okay, let\\'s let the Alan-bashing begin. Who\\'s gonna take the first shot, hmm?  (Silence.)  Monica: C\\'mon!  Ross: ...I\\'ll go. Let\\'s start with the way he kept picking at- no, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t do this, can\\'t do this. We loved him.  All: Loved him! Yeah! He\\'s great!  Monica: Wait a minute! We\\'re talking about someone that I\\'m going out with?  All: Yeah!  Rachel: And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.)  The Guys: (reluctantly) Yeah.  Joey: Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.  Phoebe: Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!  Ross: ...What shoe?  Phoebe: From the nursery rhyme. \\'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...\\'  (Dubious pause.)  Ross: ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.  Rachel: What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y\\'know, it.  Monica: Really!  Chandler: Oh, yeah. I\\'d marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I\\'m gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)  Ross: You know what I like most about him, though?  All: What?  Ross: The way he makes me feel about myself.  All: Yeah...  Commercial Break  [Scene: Central Perk, Monica is alone as Ross, Rachel, Chandler, and Joey enter dejectedly in softball gear.]  Monica: Hi.. how was the game?  Ross: Well..  All: WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!  Monica: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?  Joey: Alan.  Ross: He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...  Rachel: I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.  Chandler: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..  Monica: Can I ask you guys a question? D\\'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..  Ross: What?  Monica: ..I dunno, a little too Alan?  Rachel: Well, no. That\\'s impossible. You can never be too Alan.  Ross: Yeah, it\\'s his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.  Chandler: I personally could have a gallon of Alan.  [Scene: A street, Phoebe walks up to a homeless person (Lizzie) she knows.]  Phoebe: Hey, Lizzie.  Lizzie: Hey, Weird Girl.  Phoebe: I brought you alphabet soup.  Lizzie: Did you pick out the vowels?  Phoebe: Yes. But I left in the Ys. \\'Cause, y\\'know, \"sometimes y\". Uh, I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.)  Lizzie: Saltines?  Phoebe: No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?  Lizzie: What? (She opens the envelope Phoebe has given her.) Oh my God, there\\'s really money in here.  Phoebe: I know.  Lizzie: Weird Girl, what are you doing?  Phoebe: No, I want you to have it. I don\\'t want it.  Lizzie: No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.  Phoebe: Oh, that\\'s fine, no.  Lizzie: Would you like my tin-foil hat?  Phoebe: No. \\'Cause you need that. No, it\\'s okay, thanks.  Lizzie: Please, let me do something.  Phoebe: Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we\\'re even. Okay?  Lizzie: Okay.  Phoebe: Okay.  [Scene: Chandler\\'s office, Chandler looks around, opens his desk drawer, takes a puff of a cigarette, sprays around some air freshener, and takes some breath spray.  He types for a little while, opens the drawer again, and takes another drag of the cigarette.   While not paying attention, he sprays the breath spray around the room, takes a squirt of air freshener and gags.]  [Scene: A Street, Phoebe and Lizzie are at a hot dog vendor.]  Lizzie: Keep the change. (To Phoebe) Sure you don\\'t wanna pretzel?  Phoebe: No, I\\'m fine.  Lizzie: (leaves) See ya.  (Phoebe opens the can and reacts.)  Phoebe: Huh!  [Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is telling everyone about her discovery.]  Ross: A thumb?!  (Phoebe nods.)  All: Eww!  Phoebe: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!  Chandler: Well, maybe it\\'s a contest, y\\'know? Like, collect all five?  Phoebe: Does, um, anyone wanna see?  All: Nooo!  (Chandler lights a cigarette.)  All: Oh, hey, don\\'t do that! Cut it out!  Rachel: It\\'s worse than the thumb!  Chandler: Hey, this is so unfair!  Monica: Oh, why is it unfair?  Chandler: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey\\'s constant knuckle-cracking isn\\'t annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can\\'t you accept me for this?  (An awkward silence ensues.)  Joey: ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?  Rachel: Well, I-I could live without it.  Joey: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?  (Phoebe spits out her hair.)  Ross: Oh, now, don\\'t listen to him, Pheebs, I think it\\'s endearing.  Joey: Oh, (Imitating Ross) \"you do, do you\"?  (Monica laughs and snorts.)  Ross: You know, there\\'s nothing wrong with speaking correctly.  Rachel: \"Indeed there isn\\'t\"... I should really get back to work.  Phoebe: Yeah, \\'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.  Rachel: Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.  (They degenerate into bickering and Chandler happily starts to smoke, undisturbed.)  [Scene: Iridium, Monica and Paula are working.]  Monica: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?  Paula: No.  Monica: Okay.. Well, I\\'m going out with a guy my friends all really like.  Paula: Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!  Monica: Can you believe it? ...Y\\'know what? I just don\\'t feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don\\'t feel the thing.  Paula: Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that\\'s how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!  Monica: I know.. it\\'s gonna be really hard.  Paula: Well, he\\'s a big boy, he\\'ll get over it.  Monica: No, he\\'ll be fine. It\\'s the other five I\\'m worried about.  [Scene: Cental Perk, Joey and Ross are persecuting Chandler about his smoking.]  Joey: Do you have any respect for your body?  Ross: Don\\'t you realise what you\\'re-you\\'re doing to yourself?  Chandler: Hey, y\\'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.  Rachel: (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It\\'s Alan, he wants to speak to you.  Chandler: Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what\\'s up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it\\'s not that big- ..well, that\\'s true,..

Rachel: We didn\\'t change..  Joey: So that\\'s it? It\\'s over? Just like that?  Phoebe: You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair)  Monica: Look, I- I could go on pretending-  Joey: Okay!  Monica: -but that wouldn\\'t be fair to me, it wouldn\\'t be fair to Alan- It wouldn\\'t be fair to you!  Ross: Who-who wants fair? Y\\'know, I just want things back. Y\\'know, the way they were.

She is so peaceful.  Phoebe: (waking and startling them) Oh! What what what! ...Hi.  Ross: It\\'s okay, y\\'know, you just nodded off again.  Monica: What\\'s going on with you?  Phoebe: I got no sleep last night!  Ross: Why?  Phoebe: My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they\\'re both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they\\'re constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they\\'re having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!

I walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I\\'m fine.  Joey: Hey, that woman\\'s got an ass like Carol\\'s! (They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.  [Scene: Central Perk, Rachel, Lesile, Kiki, and Joanne are talking.]  Rachel: So c\\'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!  Kiki: Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!  Joanne: Alright. Let\\'s talk reality for a second.  Rachel: Okay.  Joanne: When are you coming home?  Rachel: What? Guys, I\\'m not.  Joanne: C\\'mon, this is us.  Rachel: I\\'m not! This is what I\\'m doing now. I\\'ve got this job-  Kiki: Waitressing?  Rachel: Okay, I\\'m not just waitressing. I\\'m.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.  Leslie: Well. Your mom didn\\'t tell us about the blobbies.

But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can\\'t operate. But we can prep the guy!  Monica: Uh, Rach, it\\'s the Visa card people.  Rachel: Oh, God, ask them what they want.  Monica: (on phone) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there\\'s been some unusual activity on your account.  Rachel: But I haven\\'t used my card in weeks!  Monica: That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you\\'re okay.  Rachel: They wanna know if I\\'m okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I\\'m okay, okay, let\\'s see. Well, let\\'s see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I\\'m getting coffee! And it\\'s not even for me! So if that sounds like I\\'m okay, okay, then you can tell them I\\'m okay, okay?  Monica: (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?  Rachel: Alright, c\\'mon! (Miserably) Let\\'s play Twister!  [Scene: Madison Square Garden, the guys are trying to find their seats.]  Ross: (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.  Chandler: What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?  Ross: No, actually I was just saying it looks like we\\'re not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...  Joey: C\\'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.

Rachel: But see, it was a plan. Y\\'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything\\'s just kinda like...  Phoebe: Floopy?  Rachel: Yeah.  Monica: So what, you\\'re not the only one. I mean, half the time we don\\'t know where we\\'re going. You\\'ve just gotta figure at some point it\\'s all gonna come together, and it\\'s just gonna be... un-floopy.  Phoebe: Oh, like that\\'s a word.  Rachel: Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn\\'t come together?  Monica: ...Pheebs?  Phoebe: Oh, well... \\'cause.... you just... I don\\'t like this question.  Rachel: Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don\\'t get magic beans? I mean, what if all we\\'ve got are.. beans?

Chandler: Listen, it\\'s kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we\\'d be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)  Receptionist: (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.)  Ross: (jumping to his feet) Look, I don\\'t wanna make any trouble, okay, but I\\'m in a lot of pain here, alright?

I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who\\'s he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c\\'mon Dora, don\\'t be mad... I know we both said some things we didn\\'t mean, but that doesn\\'t mean we still don\\'t love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y\\'know, I feel like I\\'ve lost her..

Chandler: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?  Joey: He\\'s right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.  Ross: Look, it\\'s just a little more complicated...  Chandler: Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?  Ross: Little louder, okay, I think there\\'s a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn\\'t quite hear you...  Chandler: Then what?  Ross: My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles the last part)  Joey: What?  Ross: It was my first time.  Joey: With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh.  Chandler: So in your whole life, you\\'ve only been with oneâ€”(He gets a look too)â€”oh.  Joey: Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could\\'ve done tonight!  [Scene: Monica and Rachel\\'s, the girls are still out on the balcony.]  Monica: Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?  Phoebe: Uh-huh.  Monica: Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!  Phoebe: Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don\\'t feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.  Monica: What?! You slept with Jason?  Phoebe: You\\'d already broken up.  Rachel: How long?  Phoebe: A couple hours.  Monica: Oh, that\\'s nice!  Rachel: Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.  Monica: Excuse me?!  Rachel: Hello?

(Ross enters off camera)  Both: Hey, buddy.  Ross: Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.)  Receptionist: (sarcastic) Oh, that\\'s attractive.  Chandler: Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.  Ross: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where\\'s my puck?  Joey: Oh, ah- the kid has it.  Ross: The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh, that\\'s, that\\'s my puck.

Well, I\\'m rubber, you\\'re glue, whateverâ€”(to Chandler)â€”can\\'t do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.  Kid: No.  Ross: \\'Yes\\', how about. C\\'mere. Gimme!  Kid: No! No!

End  The Last Alchemist of Alaria Chapter 1: The Whispering Sands  The wind howled like a banshee across the desolate expanse of the Alarian Desert, whipping sand against the weathered face of Elara, the last alchemist of her kind. Her weathered leather cloak billowed behind her like a tattered banner as she trudged through the endless dunes, her eyes narrowed against the harsh sunlight.  Elara\\'s once-vibrant green eyes were now clouded with fatigue and despair. The weight of her burden, the last remnants of her people\\'s ancient knowledge, pressed heavily upon her. The Alchemists of Alaria, once revered for their mastery of the elements and their ability to heal the land, were now hunted and ostracized, their magic deemed too powerful, too unpredictable by the tyrannical King Azrael.  Elara clutched the tattered leather pouch containing the few remaining Alaria Texts, their ancient script barely visible under the relentless erosion of sand and time. These texts held the secrets of her people\\'s magic, the delicate balance between the elements that had sustained Alaria for centuries. If she lost them, the knowledge would be lost forever, plunging Alaria into an age of darkness and decay.  Suddenly, a flicker of movement caught her eye. A lone Sand Serpent, its scales shimmering like gold under the sun, slithered towards her, its forked tongue tasting the air. Elara\\'s hand instinctively went to the silver dagger strapped to her thigh, her heart hammering against her ribs.

    "\n",
    "\"blue\" (90% probability)\n",

    "\"clear\" (8% probability)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"dark\" (2% probability)\n",
    "\n",
    "Updated Text: \"The sky is blue\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The process repeats to continue generating the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Training Details\n",
    "Loss Function: \"categorical_crossentropy\" (best for multi-class word prediction).\n",
    "Optimizer: \"adam\" (efficient learning).\n",
    "Metric: \"accuracy\" (to track how well the model predicts words).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Final Thoughts\n",
    "The model learns to predict the next word based on context.\n",
    "It can be used for autocomplete, AI-generated text, and chatbots.\n",
